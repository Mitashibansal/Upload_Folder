## Description: 
Page using HTML and JavaScript that will allow the user to select a folder. On selecting the folder, the user should be able to see a HTML table with 2 columns:
1.	File Name
2.	File Size
These columns will show the appropriate data for each file.
Some constraints that has taken care of:
1.	The input button should be custom, and its inner text should be “Choose Folder”.
2.	The files should be sorted with respect to their extension in alphabetical order. (this is optional but it may be considered for bonus marks, therefore leading to higher chances of getting shortlisted).
3.	File size for each file should be displayed keeping in mind the following (stackoverflow.com might help in this case):
a.	If a file is greater than 0 bytes and smaller than 1 kB, the unit used should be “bytes”
b.	If a file is greater than or equal to 1 kB and smaller than 1 MB, the unit used should be “kB”
c.	If a file is greater than or equal to 1 MB and smaller than 1 GB, the unit used should be “MB”
d.	If a file is greater than or equal to 1 GB and smaller than 1 TB, the unit used should be “MB”

1.	File Name
2.	File Size
```These columns will show the appropriate data for each file.
Some constraints that has taken care of:
1.	The input button should be custom, and its inner text should be “Choose Folder”.
2.	The files should be sorted with respect to their extension in alphabetical order.
3.	File size for each file should be displayed keeping in mind the following :
    a.	If a file is greater than 0 bytes and smaller than 1 kB, the unit used should be “bytes”
    b.	If a file is greater than or equal to 1 kB and smaller than 1 MB, the unit used should be “kB”
    c.	If a file is greater than or equal to 1 MB and smaller than 1 GB, the unit used should be “MB”
